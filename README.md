# simon-Game
This project is a web-based implementation of the classic Simon game. The game consists of four colored buttons that light up in a sequence that the player has to memorize and repeat. With each level, the sequence grows longer and more challenging. The objective is to repeat the sequence as long as possible without making a mistake.
